## LendingClub Loan Prediction Project

### Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to employ machine learning methodologies for automating loan approval decisions at LendingClub, an American peer-to-peer lending company.

LendingClub has the unique distinction of being the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It also facilitates loan trading on a secondary market. The overarching goal is to fully automate their lending procedures, and this project aims to contribute toward this end by developing and deploying robust machine learning models.
